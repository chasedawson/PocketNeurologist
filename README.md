# PocketNeurologist
Pocket Neurologist, a mobile Android application, was developed as a tool to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) in its early stages. The app hosts a series of tests, all self-performed by the user, that use a multitude of built-in sensors to record information about several primary motor symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. 

Studies have shown that abnormal blink rates can be attributed to PD. While separate from the mobile application yet conributing to the Pocket Neuorlogist mission, Java software was created that that can calculate blink rate from video input.

Unfortunately, this project wasn't fully finished and is no longer under development.
